## Road to the ICPC 2026 finals
2025 will be my final year in college, as well as my last opportunity to compete in the ICPC. I have a straightforward yet ambitious goal: **to reach the finals**. It won’t be easy, but I’m certain it will be worth it. I truly believe I have the potential to be among the best participants in Peru and South America.

On this page of my blog, I’ll be documenting this challenging journey.

I will be there no matter what.

### How its going (10/02/2025)

I have been solving codeforces problems with regularity this year and the biggest improve its on my speed. Also, I am now practicing with the help of the website [themecp.vercel.app](https://themecp.vercel.app/)
