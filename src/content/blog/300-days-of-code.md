## Road to the ICPC 2026 finals
2025 will be my final year in college, as well as my last opportunity to compete in the ICPC. I have a straightforward yet ambitious goal: **to reach the finals**. It won’t be easy, but I’m certain it will be worth it. I truly believe I have the potential to be among the best participants in Peru and South America.

On this page of my blog, I’ll be documenting this challenging journey **every single day** for the next 300 days.

I will be there no matter what.

## Week 1 
(2024-12-08 to 2024-12-14)

This week, my focus is on upsolving problems from past Codeforces rounds and revisiting the last ICPC contest I participated in.

### Day 1
Today I solved 2 problems from the [Codeforces Round 992 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/2040). I also upsolved the remaining four problems from the contest.
