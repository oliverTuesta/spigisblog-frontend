## Road to the ICPC 2026 finals
2025 will be my final year in college, as well as my last opportunity to compete in the ICPC. I have a straightforward yet ambitious goal: **to reach the finals**. It won’t be easy, but I’m certain it will be worth it. I truly believe I have the potential to be among the best participants in Peru and South America.

On this page of my blog, I’ll be documenting this challenging journey **every single day** for the next 300 days.

I will be there no matter what.

## Week 1 
(2024-12-08 to 2024-12-14)

This week, my focus is on solving 1400 - 1600 codeforces problems.

### Day 1
Today I solved 2 problems from the [Codeforces Round 992 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/2040). I also upsolved the third problem.

### Day 2
Something that might seem obvios but difficult to consider when learning is that, like in the gym if you want your muscles to grow you have to make an effort pushing the limit of your body, for competitive programming you have to push your thinking to the point that it bothers you to keep trying. And that is what I did today, I was solving a problem and had an idea of how to solve it but it had a lot of details to consider, so I tried my best and in an hour I implement it. https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2037/E

### Day 3
Today I solved this problem: https://codeforces.com/contest/2034/problem/D

### Day 4
Today I solved this problem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2045/C, it took me about 15 minutes to think the solution and other 20 to implement it

### Day 5 and 6
I am a shame

### Day 7
Today I solved this problem: https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2028/C, After trying for half an hour I had to look at the editorial and then I code it by myself.

### Review
I learned a lot this week mainly because I changed my approach for leaning, now I'm doing problems above my level. I realize that it takes me, for most 1600 rated problems, within 30 minutes and one hour to think in the solution. Ironically, I am exited because I have a lot of room for improvement and I feel confident that if I keep practicing sooner than later I will be solving 1600 rated problems in less than 30 minutes.

## Week 2
(2024-12-15 to 2024-12-21)

I will keep solving 1600 rated problems

### Day 8
Today I participated in the [Codeforces Round 993 (Div. 4)](https://codeforces.com/contest/2044). I solved 6 problems in the contest and upsolved 1 afterwards. It had a lot of fun and I'm expecting to get to specalist with the results.
