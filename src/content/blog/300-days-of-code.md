## Road to the ICPC 2026 finals
2025 will be my final year in college, as well as my last opportunity to compete in the ICPC. I have a straightforward yet ambitious goal: **to reach the finals**. It won’t be easy, but I’m certain it will be worth it. I truly believe I have the potential to be among the best participants in Peru and South America.

On this page of my blog, I’ll be documenting this challenging journey **every single day** for the next 300 days.

I will be there no matter what.

## Week 1 
(2024-12-08 to 2024-12-14)

This week, my focus is on upsolving problems from past Codeforces rounds and revisiting the last ICPC contest I participated in.

### Day 1
Today I solved 2 problems from the [Codeforces Round 992 (Div. 2)](https://codeforces.com/contests/2040). I also upsolved the third problem.

### Day 2
Something that might seem obvios but difficult to consider when learning is that, like in the gym if you want your muscles to grow you have to make an effort pushing the limit of your body, for competitive programming you have to push your thinking to the point that it bothers you to keep trying. And that is what I did today, I was solving a problem and had an idea of how to solve it but it had a lot of details to consider, so I tried my best and in an hour I implement it. https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/2037/E
