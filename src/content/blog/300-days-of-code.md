## Road to the ICPC 2026 finals
2025 will be my final year in college, as well as my last opportunity to compete in the ICPC. I have a straightforward yet ambitious goal: **to reach the finals**. It won’t be easy, but I’m certain it will be worth it. I truly believe I have the potential to be among the best participants in Peru and South America.

I’ll be documenting this challenging journey on my blog.

I will be there no matter what.
