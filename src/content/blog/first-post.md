## I'm Green!!

Today was an exciting day for me. After three years of practicing competitive programming, I finally became a pupil on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/spigi). Does this mean I'm a pro hacker, a master at coding? No. Does it mean I'm in the top 10% of coders or something like that? No. It simply means that I'm improving. This achievement might not mean much to anyone else, but it means a lot to me. I'm really happy because, in the past few weeks, I had been feeling like all my effort was useless.

## What's Next for My CP Journey?

As my favorite book, _The Way of Kings_, says: **Journey before destination**. This means that what matters more than the ultimate goal is the journey itself. In this case, solving problems, participating in contests, meeting people who are passionate about CP, and **always practicing** are more important than the achievements.

## ICPC

In a few weeks, the most important contest will take place: the ICPC. I'm preparing for this event by learning new techniques like segment trees, square root decomposition, matrix chain multiplication, and probably the hardest of all: programming logic.

## Thank you for reading :)

Yesterday, I planned to publish something completely different, but today, life smiled at me, and I managed to finally reach the pupil rank on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/spigi). So, this will be my first blog post ever. This achievement means a lot to me. Iâ€™m determined to keep improving, not just in CP but in life in general.

Great things are coming, I'm sure of it.
